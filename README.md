 Final Project In Python Programming For Security.

1. Hello everyone, this is my final project in python programming for security.

2. This is a tool to scan availability of hosts in the network and their open ports, if the script will find port 22 on the scanned host, it will offer you to preform brute force on the ssh service.

3. In order to run this script in your environment please install the required liberies:"scapy" and "paramiko".
